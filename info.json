    "DESCRIPTION" : "Ridinginstyle00:\n\nThanks for installing, this Repo includes some useful cogs that I use on my server quite often! It includes the following cogs: commands, duels, Levels. Commands is just a cog with a bunch of fun little commands. Please note that every time you use one of the picture commands in the commands cog, it downloads the photo each time (<-- This may be updated at some point to not do so).\n\nIf you haven't already, join this fabulous server where I managed to get most of my work done: https://discord.me/Red-DiscordBot \n This is also the server of the person who made Red herself!"
