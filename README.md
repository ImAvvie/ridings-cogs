From duels, to a leveling system, to even some nifty little commands that can be used for fun. You have duels (although I haven't really been in the mood to improve it) which allows you to "duel" others with funny little attacks you put into it. And you have levels, similar to Mee6 (almost exactly like Mee6 in calculations) and his leveling system. Then you got some funny little commands like [p]? or [p]datboi.

# Contact Info

I'm typically online about once a day. USUALLY, around the same time each day, and I'm in [TwentySix's discord](https://discord.gg/xQnmfjE), so if you need any help or anything you can give me a call there. But I'd prefer that you send me a PM. If you don't feel like sending a PM, you can email me here: ridinginstyle00@gmail.com

# Credits

Well the majority of the credits goes to the absolutely wonderful, magical TwentySix for making Red, and for making her (Red) open source. The rest of the credits goes to Axios and funnyman2213 (Axas#7680, Funnyman2213#1937 (<-- discord names & ID numbers)). I also sorta kinda took Axios' License which originally came from Redjumpman. Thanks guys!
